Problem Description:

Write a program that returns the product of all elements present in the list.
Constraints:

1 <= |A| <= 100
1 <= A <= 100
Note: It is guaranteed that the resultant product will be <= 1015
Input Format:

An integer array A as the function argument.
Output Format:

Product of elements in integer format
Sample Input:

A = [7, 9, 2, 51]
Sample Output:

6426
Sample explanation:

The product of all the elements is 7 * 9 * 2 * 51 = 6426 is returned.
==================

def product(lst):
    ''' input:lst-List of elements in integer format
         output:Return the product as result.'''
    
    result = 1
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
#    A = list(map(int,input().split()))
 

    for i in range(len(lst)):
        result = result * lst[i]

    
    return result
