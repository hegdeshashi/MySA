Problem Description:

Write a program that will keep track of items for a shopping list. The program should keep asking for new items as input until “end” is entered, print the full shopping list at the end.

Input Format:

Input is taken from the user for different elements until end is input.
Output Format:

The list of all elements of the shopping list
Sample Input:

Fruits
Notebooks
Perfume
Shoes
end
Sample Output:

['Fruits', 'Notebooks', 'Perfume', 'Shoes']
Sample explanation:

Fruits, Notebooks, Perfume, and Shoes strings are only added to the shopping list because after Shoes end is input therefore it shouldn't be included in the output list.
