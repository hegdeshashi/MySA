Problem Description:

Write a program that returns the list of elements that are present in the given list and are divisible by 5 and 7.

Input Format:

The only argument is the given list of elements
Output Format:

Return a list consisiting of the elements that are divisible by 5 and 7 from the given list.
Sample Input:

[23, 34, 25, 35, 66, 70, 14]
Sample Output:

[35, 70]
Sample explanation:

Only 35 and 70 are divisible by 5 and 7 from the list [23,34,25,35,66,70,14] 
therefore the list consisting of only these two elements is returned.
===================

def divisible(lst):
    ''' input:lst-List of elements in integer format
         output:Return the list of elements divisible by 5 and 7'''
    
    elements=[]
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if((lst[i] % 5) == 0) and ((lst[i] % 7) == 0):
            elements.append(lst[i])
        
          
            

    
    return elements
