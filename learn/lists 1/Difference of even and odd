Problem Description:

Write a program to find the difference between the sum of all even elements and the sum of all odd elements from the given list.

Input Format:

A list containing integers.
Output Format:

The difference of the even and odd elements sum in integer format.
Sample Input:

1
56 63 87 24 32 13 15 19 44 52
Sample Output:

11
Sample explanation:

The sum of even elements is: 56 + 24 + 32 + 44 + 52 = 208. 
The sum of odd elements is: 63 + 87 + 13 + 15 + 19 = 197. 
Difference between even elements and odd elements sum is 208 - 197 = 11.

====================

def even_odd(lst):
    diff = 0
    ''' input:lst-List of elements
         output:Return diff in integer format which stores difference'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    odd_sum,even_sum = 0,0
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n):
        if (lst[i] % 2 == 0):
            even_sum += lst[i]
        else:
            odd_sum += lst[i] 
    #print(even_sum,odd_sum)
    if (even_sum >= 0):
        diff = even_sum - odd_sum
    else:
        diff = odd_sum - even_sum    
    return diff
