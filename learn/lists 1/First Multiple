Problem Description:

Write a program for a given integer x and a list ls to return the first multiple of x that occurs in the list, and if there isnâ€™t any multiple of x in the list then return -1.

Input Format:

The first input to the function is a list ls and the second input is the integer x.
Output Format:

Return the multiple of x from the list in integer format, else return -1.
Sample Input:

1
4
2 1 2 4 3 5
Sample Output:

4
Sample explanation:

In the list, the first element that is a multiple of 4 is 4.
=======================

def first_multiple(ls,x):
    ans = -1
    ''' input:ls-List of elements and x-indicates the integer
         output:Return ans from the list that is divisible by x'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE

    n = len(ls)

    for i in range(n):
        if ((ls[i] % x) == 0):
            ans = ls[i]
            break
            
    return ans
