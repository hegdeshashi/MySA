Problem Description

Write a program to input N numbers array, a number X and a number Y from user and insert an element Y in it at specified position X. X is based on 1-based indexing.

Note: When an element is inserted at position X, all elements that were already present at position >= X, gets shifted to one position right, not replaced.
===============
    N = int(input())
    l = input().split()

    for i in range(N):
        l[i] = int(l[i])

    X=int(input())
    Y=int(input())
    l.insert(X-1,Y)
    for i in l:
        print(i,end=" ")
