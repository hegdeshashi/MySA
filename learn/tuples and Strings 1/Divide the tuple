Problem Description:

Write a program to divide a given tuple into two tuples that contain even and odd indexed elements of the original tuple. Print both these tuples in the given output format.

Input Format:

The input contains a tuple as an argument to the function.
Output Format:

Print two tuples one for odd indexed elements and another for even indexed elements in the following format:
Odd: (....)
Even: (....)
Sample Input:

1
(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)
Sample Output:

Odd: (10, 5, 10, 10, 5, 8)
Even: (8, 2, 15, 8, 8, 2)
===========================

def odd_even_split_tuple(tup):
    ''' input:tup-indicates the tuple
         output:print two tuples one for even indexed and odd indexed in the given output format'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    odd = tuple()
    even = tuple()
    for i in range(len(tup)):
        if ( (i +1)%2 == 0):
            even += (tup[i],)
        else:
            odd += (tup[i],)
    print("Odd:", odd)
    print("Even:", even)
