Problem Description:

Write a program to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not. Return True if it is palindrome else return False.

Note: A string is said to be a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string itself.

Input Format:

First line will have the number of test cases. For each testcase there will be single line of input consisting of a string.
Output Format:

Resultant string
Sample Input 1:

1
level
Sample Output 1:

True
Sample explanation:

'level' when reversed returns 'level' only which are same therefore True is returned.
Sample Input 2:

1
Scaler
Sample Output 2:

False
Sample explanation:

'Scaler' when reversed returns 'relacS' which is not equal to original string therefore False is returned.
=============================

def isPalindrome(s):
    '''Input: s takes the string as input
       Output:return the True or False'''
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    
    rev_s = s[::-1]
    if (s == rev_s):
        return True
    else: 
        return False
