Problem Description:

Given a string, complete the function modify() that returns the string after performing string modifications according to the following conditions:

1) If the length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.

2) Otherwise add 'ing' at the end of the given string.

3) If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead.

Input Format:

First-line will have the number of test cases. For each testcase there will be a single line of input consisting of a string.
Output Format:

Resultant string in string format
Sample Input 1:

1
Am
Sample Output 1:

Am
Sample explanation:

The length of "Am" is lesser than 3 therefore it is returned as it is.
Sample Input 2:

1
Sow
Sample Output 2:

Sowing
Sample explanation:

The length of "Sow" is equal to 3 therefore it is returned after adding 'ing' at the end.

Sample Input 3:

1
string
Sample Output 3:

stringly
Sample explanation:

The length of "string" is greater than 3 and it has 'ing' at the end therefore it is returned after adding "ly" at the end.
