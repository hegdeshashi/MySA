Problem Description:

Write a program to print all Natural numbers from 1 to N and from N to 1 inclusive, where N is given as an argument.

Note1: First print from 1 to N then in new line print again from N to 1

Note2: You need not take input in this problem, you need to only implement the function provided.

Note3: There is 1 line gap between two output lines and a space between numbers in same line.

Problem Constraints:

1 <= N <= 1000
Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of test cases t
The next t lines will have different values of N according to testcases
Output Format:

For each testcase there will be two lines of output:  
The first line is N space-separated integers from 1 to N.
The next line is N space-separated integers from N to 1.
Sample Input:

1
5
Sample Output:

1 2 3 4 5

5 4 3 2 1

==============

def sequence(n):
    '''input: n = A single integer for the range where n is inclusive
       output: First Print from 1 to N and new line Print from N to 1'''
    #N = int(input())

    for i in range(1,n+1):
        print(i,end=" ")
    print("\n")
    
    for i in range(n,0,-1):
        print(i,end=" ")
