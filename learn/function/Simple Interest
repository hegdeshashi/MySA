Problem Description:

Write a program to calculate the total amount if the principal amount, simple interest rate per annum, and time in the number of days are given. The simple interest rate per annum is provided as a percentage. Assuming that there are 365 days in a year, print the total amount rounded up to 2 decimal places.

Note 1: Use round(ans,2) to round up ans up to two decimals

Note 2: You need not take input in this problem, you need only to implement the function provided.

Input Format:

For each testcase there will be three lines of input as follows:  
The 3 lines have numbers  
The first line describes the time in number of days in int format 
The second line describes the principal amount in float format
The third line describes the interest rate per annum in percentage in float format
Output Format:

Total amount in float format
Sample Input:

1  
789
10000.0
1.3
Sample Output:

10281.01
================

def simple_int(time,pa,ir):
    ''' time, pa, ir represents the time in number of days, principal amount and rate of interest
        Return the simple interest'''
    ans = 0
    time = time /365
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    ans = pa + ( pa * ir * time) / 100
    
    
    return round(ans,2)
