Set the value of variable a, b and c such that the following condition evaluates to true:

a = -1 # change this
b = -1 # change this
c = -1 # change this

# DO NOT CHANGE THIS
x = a < b + c

print(x) # this should be True
Note: You need to write the code from scratch in the code editor.
==========================================
a = 1# __ change this
b = 1 # __ change this
c = 1# __ change this

# DO NOT CHANGE THIS
x = a < b + c

print(x) # this should be True
