Problem Description:

Given an input string, write a program to count the frequency of each character in the string. Map the characters and their respective frequency into a dictionary and return that dictionary.

Note: In the back-end, we are just checking the items in the dictionary, not the order therefore True will be printed if the returned dictionary has the same items as expected otherwise False will be printed.

Input Format:

The first and the only arguement to the function is a string.
Output Format:

Returned output must be in a dictionary format. The keys must be the unique characters in the string, and the values should 
be the frequency of those characters in the given string.
Sample Input:

ABC
Sample Output:

{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1}
Output Explanation:

In the string 'ABC', there are three unique characters: 'A', 'B', and 'C'. 
They occur once in the string and hence their count values are 1.

def dict_freq(str1):
    '''str1 is a string
       Ouput -> A dictionary is expected to be returned'''

    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE

    dict = {}

    for i in str1:
        if i in dict:
            dict[i] += 1
        else:
           dict[i] = 1

    return dict
