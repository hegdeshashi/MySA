Problem Description
Mr. Q has a diary in which a lot of numbers are written. He wants to know the sum of digits for every number. First Ask Mr. Q about the numbers written in the diary and then write a code to find the sum of digits for every number.
Note: Total different Numbers are T and for every number (let's say N) you need to find the Sum of digits.

Problem Constraints

1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000
0 &lt;= N &lt;= 100000000
Input Format

The first line is T which means the count of numbers.
Each of the next T lines contain an integer N.
. Output Format

T lines each containing one integer representing the sum of the digits of the input integer.
Example Input

Input 1:
2
5
1001

Input 2:
2
123
1589
Example Output

Output 1:
5
2

Output 2:
6
23
Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
5 has only 1 digit hence sum is 5.
Sum(1001) = 1+0+0+1 = 2.

Explanation 2:
Sum(123) = 1+2+3 = 6.
Sum(1589) = 1+5+8+9 = 23.
======================================


T = int(input())

while (T != 0):
    N = input()
    sum = 0
    x= len(N)
    
    for i in range( 0,x):
        sum += int(N[i])
    print (sum)
    T = T-1
