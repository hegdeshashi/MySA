Problem Description
Given two integer arrays, A and B of size N and M, respectively. Your task is to find all the common elements in both the array.

NOTE:

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it appears in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
First argument is an integer array A of size N.

Second argument is an integer array B of size M.



Output Format
Return an integer array denoting the common elements.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 2, 1]
 B = [2, 3, 1, 2]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 1, 4, 10]
 B = [3, 6, 2, 10, 10]


Example Output
Output 1:

 [1, 2, 2]
Output 2:

 [2, 10]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Elements (1, 2, 2) appears in both the array. Note 2 appears twice in both the array.
Explantion 2:

 Elements (2, 10) appears in both the array.

    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers

                    b[i]+=1
                else:
                    b[i]=1
            return b      

        C=list_to_dict(A)

        ans=[]
        for i in B:    
            if i in C and C[i]!=0:  
                ans.append(i)
                C[i]-=1 # the freq is decreased to find common no of freq of elemnt
# in both A and B
        return ans
