Problem Description
Given an array A of N integers. Count the number of elements that have at least 1 elements greater than itself.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109


Input Format
First and only argument is an array of integers A.


Output Format
Return the count of elements.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [3, 1, 2]
Input 2:
A = [5, 5, 3]


Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
The elements that have at least 1 element greater than itself are 1 and 2
Explanation 2:
The elements that have at least 1 element greater than itself is 3

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        
        max_num = A[0]
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if A[i] > max_num:
                max_num = A[i]
                count = 1
            elif A[i] == max_num:
                count +=1
        return (len(A)-count)
