A spider is trying to build a web for itself. The web built by it doubles every day.

If the spider entirely built the web in 15 days, how many days did it take for the spider to build 25% of the web?

Answer is an integer. Just put the number without any decimal places if it's an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.

================

If the spider has taken 15 days to complete the work that means on day 15th 100% of the work was completed and on 14th day half of 100 i.e 50% of the work was completed and on 13th day half of 50 i.e rest 25% of the work was completed.


13th day = 25% work done
14th day = 50 % work done 
15th day = 100% work done

Hence, answer is 13th dayâ€¦
