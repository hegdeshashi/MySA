Problem Description
Given an array of size N, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n/2) times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exists in the array.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 5*105
1 <= num[i] <= 109


Input Format
Only argument is an integer array.


Output Format
Return an integer.


Example Input
[2, 1, 2]


Example Output
2


Example Explanation
2 occurs 2 times which is greater than 3/2.
======================

class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @return an integer
    def majorityElement(self, A):
        n=len(A)
        candidate=A[0]
        c=1
        for i in range(1,n):
            if A[i]==candidate:
                c=c+1
            elif c==0:
                candidate=A[i]
                c=1
            elif A[i]!=candidate:
                c=c-1
        return candidate
